# Vacuum-Cold-Spray-Hydroxyapatite
This repository contains C++ code for MD simulations of high-velocity impacts of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles on a titanium substrate. The code allows you to study the mechanical deformation, stress, and temperature during these fast impacts, providing insights into the bonding mechanisms of HA particles with the substrate.
